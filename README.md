# indent-control
> Management for indentation level.

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/indent-control/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/indent-control/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Interface that combine all the indentation variables from each major mode
to one giant list.

## üèÜ Features

* Decouple from user knowing each major mode's indentation level variable. (if have)
* Keep the indentation level across buffers. If you changed the indentation level
in `buffer A` and switch to `buffer B` with the same major mode; they will have
the same indentation level.

## üî® Usage

You can tweak variable `indent-control-records ` to set the initial
indentation level for each major mode.

```elisp
(setq indent-control-records
  '((actionscript-mode     . 4)
    (c-mode                . 4)
    (c++-mode              . 4)
    (csharp-mode           . 4)
    ...
    (sql-mode              . 1)
    (typescript-mode       . 4)
    (web-mode              . 2)
    (yaml-mode             . 2)))
```

### Change indentation level

These functions will change the current indentation level for the major mode
that you currently on.

* `indent-control-inc`
* `indent-control-dec`

You can tweak variable `indent-control-delta` to change the size of the one
indentation level. The default value is `2`.

### Make indentation work across all modes

Is easy to make indentation level inherit last time modified in Emacs.
Just enable the global minor mode `indent-control-mode` then it will
automatically records all changes from the indentation level.

This minor mode is already get called in `prog-mode-hook`, but with some
major modes that they do not use inherit `prog-mode` will not work!
You would have to manually called it in each mode's startup hook.
For instance `actionscript-mode` doesn't inherit `prog-mode` so you would
have to do the following.

```elisp
(defun my-actionscript-mode-hook ()
  "My actionscript mode hook."
  (indent-control-continue-with-record))
(add-hook 'actionscript-mode-hook #'my-actionscript-mode-hook)
```
